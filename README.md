## Installation
1. To install this, first you need to install the latest version (3.8.1 as of this writing) of Python for Windows, from here:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1.exe
2. Next, download the .zip of this repository and extract it to a folder on your computer someplace you have write access (a natgeo-potd folder in your Documents folder is a fine choice).
3. Test the script by running the set-natgeo-potd-wallpaper.bat file.  Did it change your background?
4. Assuming the script worked just fine, the final task is to open the Task scheduler in windows and schedule the the set-natgeo-potd-wallpaper.bat file to run once per day. This page gives a good description of how to do this:
